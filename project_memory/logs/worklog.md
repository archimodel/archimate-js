## 2026-07-08 loop 1

- Goal: implement ArchiMate 4 support from `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-08-archimate-4-support.md`.
- Branch: `codex/archimate-4-support`.
- Initial assumption: C260/W262 licensed source text is not present locally; implementation will keep 4.0 XML/relationship conformance explicitly experimental until official source/XSD is supplied.
- Implemented versioned language profiles, moddle descriptor split, version-aware model template, language profile DI service, fallback 4.0 relationship maps, 3.x to 4.0 migration utility, profile-driven palette, multiplicity rendering/editing/persistence, tests, README, and changelog notes.
- Verification: `npm run test:language` passed with 16 tests. Changed-file `npx eslint` passed after applying mechanical lint fixes to implementation files.
- Repository-wide lint/all: final `npm run all` still fails on legacy repo-wide lint issues unrelated to the ArchiMate 4 implementation; recorded in `project_memory/runlogs/20260708-012-final-npm-run-all.txt`.
